Smart public tape is an automatic project spills the liquid using RFID sensor or MOBILE MONEY according to the amount you want to pay. This helps us to use cashless payment, to solve problem that is  in existed system and also comes with innovative system thatâ€™s use cashless payment. By achieving this system, When you switch ON Smart Public Tape you must choose type of payment either mobile money or tap card that contains money and if it is mobile money you will visit our website and follow all steps required (open website and login your mobile number  and amount you want to pay, after you click on MOMO purchase and you enter mobile number that you will use for paying and click on pay and after you will receive MOMO verification code in your phone message to confirm if your number is  real ,after verifying your code you will confirm payment by entering mobile money pin).  
Node MCU will communicate with website to carry all information of payment to Arduino. If you choose to tap card you will follow all steps required. After we have relay and pump that will pull up water. Pump is connected on relay that will switch ON that pump and we have flow rate sensor on pump that will measure the quality of water due to amount entered by client.
